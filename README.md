# Project Background
The first assignment get lower marks than the other because it was my fisrt time modelling the conceptial relationship, and I had fixed my mistake before doing my next assignment.
The second one and the third one I got almost full mark and full mark respectively, which verified my SQL skill in coding part and logical part.
